// For each objective list out the name, and any items/metroids/map tiles/events/trooper logs/logs you need to collect to complete the objective
// You can also specify a count which means you are only required to obtain that many of that category to complete the objective.
// i.e metroidCount: 2 means you only need to kill 2 of the specified metroids
// If count is omitted then it is assumed you have to get everything
